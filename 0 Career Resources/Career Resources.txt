Thank you! In case anyone is also having the same issue, this was the response I received: 

"If you havenâ€™t received an email about career resources within 10 days of completing your Professional Certificate program, please send an email to the Career Services Program Manager at career-support@coursera.org. They will be providing you with more information regarding this matter."
